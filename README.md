## Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Modeling
#### This project aims to analyze data for loans through 2007-2015 from Lending Club available on Kaggle. Dataset contains over 887,000 observations and 74 variables among which one is describing the loan status. The goal is to create machine learning model to categorize the loans as good or bad. 
#### There are various features that might or might not contribute in the predictive power of the machine learning models that are generated. The main aim of this project was to feature engineer data in a way so that no relevant information is lost and all the patterns are captured. Main focus of this project was to find ways to crunch data and deal with an inherent bias of what we call as an imbalanced dataset.
#### This project explores one of the multiple ways to deal with imbalance in observations which is resampling. Afer generating relevant features and removing noise, oversampling and undersampling was performed, a Random Forest Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model is generated for both the cases after which hyperparamter tuning and cross validation is performed.
